Executive Summary
The Datapage Platform Program will transform Blueprint into a technology-enabled growth company while building the foundation for Datapage’s commercial platform strategy. Over an initial six-month period, three integrated work streams—Blueprint Transformation, Connect 2.0 Platform Rebuild and Datapage GTM Strategy—will deliver both near-term MVP outcomes and set the long-term foundation for Datapage’s growth.
Program Intent
Datapage aims to deliver 30% revenue growth while keeping headcount increases modest. This is achieved through technology, automation, and data that scale operational leverage. The MVP platform, processes, and operating system first proven with Blueprint will power Datapage’s go-to-market strategy and serve as the foundation for broader commercial expansion. 
Three Integrated Tracks
1. Blueprint Transformation — Defines how Blueprint operates as a frontier firm, including the enterprise-wide Blueprint Operating System, success model, and leadership cadence.

2. Connect 2.0 Platform Rebuild — Delivers the full rebuild of Datapage’s core technology platform and user experience, with the Design & Entitlement MVP pilot ready to launch at the 90-day mark, and MVP versions of BPO (Blueprint Online) and Connect 1.0 modules completed by the end of six months.

3. Datapage GTM Strategy — Defines Datapage’s brand positioning, strategy to target ideal customers, and partner/investor engagement with a clear value proposition and MVP business and financial model. The strategy also features an investor-ready narrative linking Blueprint’s transformation success and the Connect 2.0 platform to Datapage’s scalable growth story.

Delivery Approach
The program uses an Agile delivery model with two-week sprints and 90-day increments. Coordination follows a lean governance structure inspired by SAFe principles, ensuring oversight without excess process. A shared cadence across all three tracks ensures synchronized progress from initial planning to build and validation. Strategic direction and key decisions are provided by the Program Leadership Team — led jointly by Mark and Darin and supported by IA’s delivery and governance teams.
Key Deliverables
At the end of six months, the program will deliver:
   * Blueprint Operating System v1 (MVP): Defined and implemented at the enterprise level, with adoption underway and iterative improvements continuing after the MVP phase.

   * Connect 2.0 Platform MVP: A unified platform launched with the Design & Entitlement pilot launching at Day 90, followed by completed MVP versions of BPO and Connect 1.0 by program close.

   * Datapage Business & Investment Model (MVP): A validated first version of Datapage’s commercial and financial framework, co-developed with Datapage leadership and positioned for refinement as operating data is collected. 

   * Project Backlog for Sustained Engineering: A prioritized list of next-phase enhancements and capabilities, including planned feature iterations, deeper automation, and expanded AI use cases to drive future development.

Outcomes
By the end of the initial six-month program, Datapage and Blueprint will have a fully operational MVP foundation that unites the Blueprint Operating System, Connect 2.0 platform, and Datapage’s initial commercial model. This foundation will be validated in practice and serve as the baseline for continued evolution across operations, technology, and market positioning.
A prioritized backlog for sustained engineering will guide the future enhancements and organizational refinements—ensuring both continuity and momentum as Datapage advances from MVP to scale.
Purpose
The Datapage Platform Program defines how Datapage will design, build, and commercialize its next-generation product and services platform.
The program unites three integrated workstreams — Blueprint Transformation, Connect 2.0 Platform Rebuild, and Datapage GTM Strategy — into a single, coordinated effort to deliver near-term MVP outcomes and establish the long-term structure for Datapage’s growth.
Blueprint serves as Client Zero, providing the live environment and operating model that guide Connect 2.0’s design and form the foundation for Datapage’s broader commercialization strategy.


Objectives
      * Transform Blueprint into a frontier firm capable of driving 30% revenue growth[a] with only a modest increase in headcount, using technology, data, and AI to scale productivity and margin. This includes designing and implementing the Blueprint Operating System (BOS) — codifying how the firm operates, makes decisions, and measures success — creating a model Datapage can replicate for future clients.

      * Rebuild the Connect 2.0 platform and user experience as the technical and experiential foundation that powers the operating model and enables Blueprint’s transformation.

      * Develop Datapage’s go-to-market and investment strategy to commercialize the combined platform and operating model, positioning Datapage as a scalable product and services company.

      * Validate the integrated model through an MVP pilot, demonstrating measurable operational and financial outcomes within Blueprint and producing the reference implementation for Datapage’s future clients.

Program Overview
The six-month Datapage Platform Program is organized around three tightly connected tracks that together define how Datapage will build, validate, and scale its next-generation platform and business model.
Each track has a distinct focus but reinforces the others, creating a closed loop between strategy, technology, and market execution:
         * Blueprint Transformation defines how Blueprint will operate as a modern, data-driven frontier firm — establishing the operating system, organizational model, and success measures that will later serve as the reference model for other Datapage clients.

         * Connect 2.0 Platform Rebuild translates that model into a new technical and user experience foundation, delivering the platform and interface that bring the operating system to life.

         * Datapage GTM Strategy turns these outcomes into a commercial and investment framework, defining how Datapage will position, price, and scale its combined platform and services business.

Together, these tracks form a single continuum — defining how Blueprint operates, delivering the platform that powers it, and establishing how Datapage monetizes and scales it.
This structure creates a unified effort to deliver near-term MVP outcomes for Blueprint while laying the long-term foundation for Datapage’s product, operating, and business model. Each track advances in parallel with deliberate interdependencies across organization, user experience, and go-to-market execution.
1. Blueprint Transformation
This track focuses on transforming Blueprint into a modern, scalable frontier firm and codifying the frameworks Datapage can later replicate for future clients. 
All work in this track is delivered under the Datapage brand, with IA acting as Datapage’s professional services arm — establishing a scalable consulting capability alongside the technology platform.
Scope includes:
            * Designing the Blueprint Operating System (BOS) — a complete model for how the firm operates, makes decisions, and measures success. The BOS becomes part of Datapage’s intellectual property alongside Connect 2.0.

            * Defining the success model — key performance measures and behavioral norms that characterize a frontier firm.

            * Leading organizational design and effectiveness, including role structure, decision rights, and leadership alignment.

            * Mapping end-to-end user journeys and Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) across Blueprint to identify dependencies, friction points, and automation opportunities.

            * Feeding journey mapping outputs directly into Connect 2.0 UX and workflow design, ensuring continuity between the operating model and product experience.

            * Conducting a technology landscape assessment to define how Connect 2.0 fits within Blueprint’s broader application ecosystem.

            * Developing a change management strategy to support adoption and alignment across teams.

Outcome:
A codified Blueprint Operating System — the integrated process, structure, and performance model that defines how a frontier firm runs. This becomes reusable Datapage IP and provides direct design input to Connect 2.0.
2. Connect 2.0 — Platform Rebuild
This track delivers the rebuild of Datapage’s core technology platform and user experience, creating the foundation for both Blueprint and future Datapage customers. Blueprint serves as Client Zero, where Connect 2.0 will be built, validated, and proven in production.
MVP Scope:
The Connect 2.0 MVP establishes the full product foundation — the core data model, infrastructure, API framework, and unified user interface and workflow engine that define the platform’s architecture and experience.
Within that foundation, a focused Design & Entitlement MVP will provide the first live implementation, enabling these Blueprint teams (currently using SharePoint Online and PowerApps tools) to transition onto Connect 2.0.
This Design & Entitlement MVP will focus on:
               * Building and validating the core data model and infrastructure foundation that future modules will depend on.

               * Designing and delivering the Connect 2.0 user interface and workflow experience for Design and Entitlement teams.

               * Implementing workflow automation to replace manual processes.

               * Creating temporary integrations back to BPO and Connect 1.0 where needed for continuity.

               * Launching the Design & Entitlement MVP pilot at Day 90, with execution and validation continuing through the next increment as BPO and Connect 1.0 are integrated into the new platform.

Architecture and Technology Approach:
                  * Connect 2.0 is designed to be cloud-native, API-first, and experience-led, with platform and UI development proceeding in parallel.

                  * Journey mapping and JTBD work from the Blueprint Transformation track directly inform UX design, workflow logic, and experience architecture.

                  * The hosting environment (Azure, AWS, or GCP) will be selected within the first two weeks, followed immediately by infrastructure setup and development environment configuration.

                  * Development begins at Day 31 and continues through Day 90 to deliver the Design & Entitlement MVP pilot.

                  * Seedcode transitions to a support-only SLA, maintaining Connect 1.0 stability during the build.

                  * During the second 90-day increment (Days 91–180), BPO (Blueprint Online) and Connect 1.0 will be fully rebuilt within Connect 2.0, creating a single, modern application environment and completing the unified Blueprint system.

                  * Datapage’s two other customers (running heavily customized Connect 1.x instances) remain out of scope until after MVP launch and will be scoped separately.
Data Governance & Migration Plan
                     * Source of Truth: Connect 2.0 becomes authoritative for Design & Entitlement at pilot cutover; BPO/Connect 1.0 remains authoritative where not yet rebuilt.
                     * Quality Gates: Completeness, referential integrity, duplicate rate, and key business rule checks must pass before cutover.
                     * Migration Phases: (1) Inventory & mapping → (2) Dry-run → (3) Shadow (read in 2.0, write in 1.0) → (4) Phased cutover by team → (5) Decommission & archive.
                     * Rollback: Documented revert steps executable within 2 hours; trigger criteria; comms tree.
                     * Lineage & Telemetry: Field-level lineage for migrated entities; change data capture enabled.
Cutover & Deprecation
Shadow period ≥ 2 weeks; UAT exit criteria approved by PLT; progressive retirement of overlapping screens in 1.0; data archive policy retained 7 years (or per legal).


Multi-Tenant Considerations:
                     * The MVP will not yet be fully multi-tenant, as SaaS-level infrastructure (tenant isolation, provisioning, billing, scaling) is not required at this stage.

                     * However, the architecture, data model, and UI will be engineered to support multi-tenancy in future releases, avoiding rework as Datapage scales to multiple customers.

AI Guardrails:
                        * Human-in-the-loop on entitlement and builder scoring decisions; explainable scoring with factor breakdowns; fairness checks each release; PII minimization and purpose binding; model performance & drift monitoring; incident playbook for model regressions.


Outcome:
Delivery of the Connect 2.0 Platform MVP — including the data model, infrastructure foundation, unified user interface, and workflow engine — with the Design & Entitlement MVP pilot ready to launch at Day 90. In the second increment, BPO and Connect 1.0 are consolidated as modules within the unified application, completing the unified Blueprint environment and establishing the baseline for Datapage’s next-generation product.
3. Datapage GTM Strategy
This track defines the go-to-market strategy, business model, and investment framework for Datapage as a product company. It translates the outcomes from Blueprint Transformation Connect 2.0 into a clear commercialization and growth strategy.
The GTM strategy identifies target markets and customer profiles, defines the value proposition and pricing model, and outlines channels and sales approaches. For Datapage, this means articulating how the MVP platform and processes proven with Blueprint will power commercial expansion and support partner and investor engagement.
Within the first 3-60 days, the team will create an initial perspective on market opportunity, product-market fit, customer acquisition, and unit economics. This framework will be refined as operating data emerges from Blueprint’s transformation and Connect 2.0 platform pilots, delivering an investor-ready narrative that links Blueprint's success to Datapage's scalable growth story.
Scope includes:
                        * Success model design—establishes growth goals, margin targets, recurring revenue structure, target market touchpoints, and clear KPIs.

                        * Target market definition—conducts market segmentation analysis to identify priority segments, ideal customer profiles, and adoption pathways.

                        * Value proposition and positioning—articulates how Datapage addresses key customer problems and differentiates from competitive alternatives.

                        * Pricing and packaging framework—develops preliminary pricing and bundled offerings for market testing.

                        * Financial modeling—builds baseline TCO and IRR models to guide investment requirements and set ROI expectations (co-developed with Datapage).

                        * Commercialization roadmap—outlines phased business plan, including market entry and scaling (co-developed with Datapage).

                        * Investment narrative—prepares an initial investor and partner deck that links Blueprint results, the Connect 2.0 vision, and the frontier firm model into one cohesive story.
                        * Pricing & Packaging Experiments: Test seat vs usage vs value-based; module bundles (Entitlement, Feasibility, Servicing); willingness-to-pay interviews with 6–8 prospects.[b]
                        * Lighthouse Customer Criteria: Market fit (jurisdiction complexity), data readiness, executive sponsor, case-study rights, and 90-day pilot commitment.[c]
Guardrails:
                           * The first 30–60 days focus on building a directional perspective, not a fully complete business plan.

                           * The goal is to create enough clarity to validate investment levels and guide next-phase priorities.

                           * Additional refinement, modeling, and market validation may continue in separate GTM workstreams after completion of the initial perspective, and as the strategy matures.
Outcome:
An initial Datapage go-to-market and investment strategy, including a first-phase financial model, market positioning, customer acquisition approach, and investor-ready narrative.

Delivery Approach — Agile Program Governance
The program operates under a standard Agile delivery model, coordinated through a light SAFe-style program governance layer that keeps work synchronized, transparent, and outcomes-focused across all three tracks. The goal is disciplined execution without unnecessary overhead — emphasizing alignment, velocity, and continuous learning.
Teams work in two-week sprints on a shared cadence, with 90-day Program Increments (PIs) aligned to major milestones. Each increment concludes with a review and planning session. Shared sprint reviews and retrospectives keep strategy, technology, and GTM progress connected and visible across teams.
Key Principles:
                                       * Deliver in increments, learn continuously. Each 90-day PI delivers tangible results that feed into the next cycle.

                                       * Align early, adapt quickly. Shared cadence ensures fast feedback and coordinated pivots.

                                       * Visibility over ceremony. Lightweight tools and dashboards replace heavy governance.

                                       * Integrated delivery. Each track operates independently but remains tied to a unified backlog and release rhythm.

Assumptions & Dependencies
The following assumptions and dependencies underpin the program’s design, timeline, and delivery approach. Each will be validated and refined as the program progresses.
                                                * Shared Ownership and Alignment: Datapage and Blueprint remain jointly owned and strategically aligned through Darin and Mark, providing consistent direction and decision-making across all tracks.

                                                * Dedicated Engagement: Blueprint leadership and functional teams will commit the time required for workshops, validation sessions, and adoption activities throughout the program.

                                                * Stakeholder Engagement Mapping: IA will provide a stakeholder engagement map estimating the expected time commitments and touchpoints for Blueprint team members. This map will be defined prior to kickoff for the Design & Entitlement focus areas and refined in the first few weeks to include other functions.

                                                * Hosting Platform Decision: The hosting platform (Azure, AWS, or GCP) will be selected within the first two weeks to enable infrastructure setup and early development.

                                                * Vendor Transition: Seedcode will move to a support-only SLA as planned, ensuring platform stability while Connect 2.0 is rebuilt.

                                                * Resource Continuity: Core delivery roles — including program management, engineering, UX, and change management — will remain consistent across both 90-day increments to ensure continuity and velocity.

                                                * MVP Scope Discipline: The MVP will focus on foundational functionality and prioritized automation, deferring broader AI enablement and multi-tenant capabilities to later increments.

                                                * Data Availability: Required data will be accessible immediately at program kickoff through the existing production environment, enabling early validation and model development.

                                                * Incremental Adoption: The Blueprint Operating System and Connect 2.0 platform will be adopted progressively, with continued expansion and optimization beyond the initial 180-day program.

                                                * Sustained Engineering Backlog: A comprehensive backlog for sustained engineering will be created prior to program close, providing continuity of development priorities and clear alignment between Datapage and IA teams for ongoing delivery.
                                                * Stakeholder Time Budget: Acquisitions 4–6 hrs/wk; Entitlement 4–6; Servicing 2–4; Leadership 2; PM/PLT 2. Names assigned at kickoff.
                                                * Baseline Access: Read access to current production data by Day 5 to validate model and migration maps.
