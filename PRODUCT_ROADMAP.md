## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What happens to our existing data in BPO, Connect 1.0, and SharePoint?
**A:** All data migrates to Connect 2.0 with complete history preserved. We run shadow period (2+ weeks) where both systems run in parallel to validate data quality before final cutover. Legacy systems remain accessible as read-only archives.

### Q: What if we need to roll back during migration?
**A:** We have a 2-hour rollback plan. If critical issues arise, we can revert to legacy systems while preserving any Connect 2.0-only data. Rollback plan tested during shadow period.

### Q: How much training will our team need?
**A:** Modern, intuitive UI requires minimal training. Plan for 2-4 hours of hands-on training per role. Pilot users (Days 1-90) provide feedback to refine training for full launch.

### Q: Can we customize workflows for our specific processes?
**A:** Yes. Workflow engine supports custom rules, approval chains, and automation triggers. We configure during implementation based on your documented processes.

### Q: What about our existing clients (Send Capital, Create Capital)?
**A:** They remain on customized Connect 1.x instances post-MVP. Multi-tenant migration planned for Days 180-360 when Connect 2.0 proven at scale with Blueprint.

### Q: How do we measure ROI?
**A:** We track 6 key metrics from Day 1: cycle time reduction, deals per FTE, draw turnaround, user adoption, data quality, uptime. Executive dashboard shows ROI in real-time.

### Q: What if AI predictions are wrong?
**A:** All AI features have human-in-the-loop design. AI recommends, humans approve. Confidence scores show prediction certainty. Models continuously tuned based on outcomes.

### Q: What happens after Day 180?
**A:** Transition to steady-state operations with sustained engineering backlog. Continuous improvements based on user feedback. AI enhancements rolled out incrementally. Multi-tenant features for Datapage commercialization.
