## Manual Sprint Creation Instructions

Since the API requires "Manage sprints" permission, create sprints manually in Jira:

1. **Go to DP01 Board:** https://vividcg.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/DP01/boards/1254
2. **Click "Create Sprint"** (bottom of backlog)
3. **Name sprints** using the exact names above (under 30 chars)
4. **Set dates** for each sprint
5. **Drag stories** from the list above into each sprint

**OR** use the script to assign stories after manually creating empty sprints.

### Days 61-90 (Sprints 5-6): Acquisitions Pipeline (Part 2) + Platform
