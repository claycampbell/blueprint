Blueprint Workshop — Detailed Summary & Outcomes
October 1, 2025
Purpose & Format
We convened to align on Blueprint’s direction, begin codifying the strategic lens that will guide decisions, and explore how the next generation of the Connect platform can remove operational friction and unlock growth. The day mixed narrative framing, journey mapping, and technology working sessions with a bias for tangible next steps and cadence.
________________


Participants & Lenses We Brought
* Blueprint: Darin (CEO), bringing deep builder/developer craft, market realism, and a bias for speed and practicality.

* Intelligent Agency team: strategy, engineering, data/AI, and org-change leaders who have shipped and scaled large platforms — here to define the backbone, sequence value, and make it real. We explicitly worked as a single integrated team rather than “throwing requirements over the wall.”

________________


How We Framed the Day (and Why)
   1. Operate vs. Platform. We decided to keep two conversations distinct — Blueprint (operating business in Seattle/Phoenix) and Connect 2.0 (Datapage-owned platform, licensed to Blueprint). Blueprint is the proving ground; Connect 2.0 is the scalable product. Keeping these separate avoids muddled priorities and clarifies value stories to investors/partners.

   2. Near-term traction, long-term leverage. The room agreed that the fastest path to value is removing friction in current journeys, while laying a platform foundation that makes each improvement reusable as a module.

   3. Bias for action. We agreed on an Agile operating rhythm (quarterly planning; two-week sprints; frequent demos) so progress is visible and the team can pivot in response to evolving business priorities.

Blueprint as a Frontier Firm
The workshop explored what it means for Blueprint to operate as a frontier firm — not simply modernizing existing systems, but redefining how infill development and lending can function in an AI-native era.
What being a frontier firm means for Blueprint:
      * Operating model & people transformation, not just technology. Connect 2.0 provides the backbone, but the real shift is in how Blueprint organizes work, measures outcomes, and delivers value to builders. Agile delivery, new measures of success, and structured decision-making are all part of that transformation - a shift in mindset as much as in ways of working.

      * Codifying expertise. Blueprint’s hard-won advantages — zero loan defaults, fast cycle times, deep entitlement know-how, design experience & expertise — become institutional capabilities embedded into processes, data models, and ways of working.

      * Builder-first philosophy at scale. Frontier firms use technology and organizational design to extend human capacity. For Blueprint, this means empowering dozens of small and mid-sized builders to thrive — offering them the speed, clarity, and financing tools usually reserved for large developers.

      * Trust as a differentiator. Onboarding builders today is time-intensive (95% Darin’s judgment), and much of Blueprint’s edge comes from personal trust. The challenge is to institutionalize trust without losing the white-glove service — using AI to pre-profile builders while ensuring that the personal handshake remains part of multi-million-dollar commitments.

      * A digital thread, not just digitized steps. Every stage (intake → entitlement → lending → servicing) becomes linked and data-rich, creating transparency and resilience across the lifecycle. This isn’t automation for efficiency alone; it’s creating a new fabric for how the business runs.

      * Narrative leadership. By operating this way, Blueprint positions itself not just as “faster and better” than peers, but as a model for addressing systemic issues like housing shortage and market volatility.

Why this framing matters:
         * It makes clear that technology is necessary but not sufficient on its own — organizational design, governance, and strategy are equally core to the transformation.

         * It sharpens the external narrative: Blueprint isn’t simply digitizing workflows, it is pioneering a new kind of firm — one designed for resilience, adaptability, and builder empowerment in a constrained housing environment.

Darin’s Story & Blueprint’s Edge (How we got here)
            * Builder DNA and zero-default lending. Blueprint’s methods were shaped on the job site and in the entitlement office — then encoded into lending practices. Since inception, Blueprint reports zero loan or builder defaults across roughly $3B in volume; expertise and local validation are central to risk management.

            * Speed as a differentiator. Years ago, deal intake was literally a “Possible Deals” folder; Blueprint Online was created to capture and triage leads at speed. Today thousands of leads per year are processed, and agents call out minute-level responses as the reason they bring Blueprint deals first.

            * Market scope. The operating focus is Seattle and Phoenix — two different contexts requiring tailored plays. National expansion of the operating company isn’t the plan today; the platform can scale even if the operator doesn’t.

            * Competitive context. Legacy Capital is the closest analog (healthy competition). The team emphasized winning on speed, clarity, and follow-through — not on spreading thin across offerings.

“We’re nothing if we’re not fast.” (agents hear back in minutes; tech and process make that possible)

Draft Objective (for validation)
Draft Objective: Blueprint is the partner of choice for infill land development and lending in the Seattle and Phoenix markets — by empowering builder success.
Why this landed: it centers the builder, reflects the integrated nature of Blueprint’s offering (acquisition → entitlement/design → lending), and remains flexible across market conditions. We agreed to refine wording with Darin before we lock it.

Strategic Lens — Drafted Using the OGSM Framework
We used the OGSM model as a structuring tool to start codifying Blueprint’s strategic lens. This surfaced candidate goals, strategies, and measures that need to be further matured with Darin before they become the business compass.
Candidate Goals (what “winning” looks like)
               * Market Share Growth by region (keep winning in Seattle, build Phoenix)
               * Revenue Growth year over year.

               * Investor Yield - scale deal volume without sacrificing yield..

               * Employee Satisfaction - baseline and pulse checks, keeping Blueprint a place where employees thrive during a period of significant change.

               * Client Satisfaction - codify builder trust into the platform, capture structured signals from builders and agents (beyond anecdotes).

We explicitly discussed using deal volume as a leading indicator (activity and share) to complement revenue and yield so we don’t over-optimize a single metric.
Candidate Strategies (how we’ll get there)
                  * Market adaptation: Seattle ≠ Phoenix; tailor workflows, expectations, and support to local norms.

                  * Technology modernization: unify intake → feasibility → entitlement → builder assignment → lending/servicing on an AI-native backbone (Connect 2.0).

                  * Data leverage: structure 5+ years of deals, plan sets, entitlement history, and financials into a usable model for decisions and forecasting.

                  * Clear GTM motions: package value for builders and agents, especially in Phoenix where awareness is nascent.

                  * Operational efficiency: automate the known bottlenecks (lead vetting, feasibility packets, entitlement cycles, consultant orchestration, builder matching).

Candidate Measures[a] (how we’ll see progress)
                     * Market share by region — how Blueprint is performing competitively in Seattle (incremental share gains) and Phoenix (building new presence).

                     * # of deals closed — a volume-based measure of throughput, giving early signal of market traction and builder engagement.

                     * Revenue growth — year-over-year financial performance, ensuring topline growth matches operational expansion.

                     * Investor yield — maintaining competitive returns as deal volume grows, reinforcing Blueprint’s reputation for disciplined risk.

                     * Employee satisfaction — pulse checks to ensure transformation is healthy and the team is engaged through change.

                     * Client satisfaction (builders & agents) — structured feedback beyond anecdotes, confirming that speed, clarity, and support are landing with the people Blueprint serves.
These remain candidates until Darin helps refine and target them.
OGSM as a Communications Tool
We also discussed the OGSM lens as a messaging platform and business scorecard: something that Blueprint could use to consistently communicate its direction and priorities with investors, employees, and external partners. Moving from ad hoc/annual planning toward a tighter, living framework will create more transparency and confidence.

Present-State Journeys & Pain (what we mapped together)
End-to-end: Lead intake → Vet/score → Offer/contract → Feasibility → Close → Assign builder → Entitlement & design → Development → Servicing.
Observed friction (and how we found it):
                        * Lead intake & vetting is still high-touch; quality varies; agents submit via multiple channels.

                        * Feasibility packets are manual PDF assemblies; lots of re-entry of information and difficulty reviewing the information in an effective, efficient way.

                        * Entitlements suffer from city correction cycles and fragmented consultant coordination.

                        * Builder assignment relies on experience and relationships vs. structured signals.

We did not assume technology alone fixes these; we discussed where people + rules + models + UX can shorten (or even completely bypass) paths rather than just “automating the old steps.”
Progressive Profiling & Feedback Loops
We explored the idea of progressive profiling: leads and deals accumulate information as they move forward, layering viability signals, entitlement forecasts, consultant throughput, and feasibility dashboards. This reinforces the vision of a live digital thread — not just static packets — and enables dashboards that track red/yellow/green viability in real time. These profiles, including deal data, would live on to help fuel future insights and decisions.

Team Roles & Structure[b]
We also dug into the specific work of Blueprint’s teams, which revealed critical friction points (s)and opportunities:
                           * Acquisition team: split between administrative intake, acquisition leads, and feasibility associates. Much of the intake is still manual.

                           * Entitlement team: acts on behalf of the builder/owner, coordinating surveyors, arborists, civil engineers, and other consultants to ensure permit packets are complete and correct.

                           * Design team: manages the library of ~1,500 plan sets and produces plan packages that flow into feasibility and entitlement. There’s significant untapped opportunity in standardization, reuse, and tighter integration with entitlement timelines.

                           * Servicing team: six people managing escrow/builder interfaces, draws, and loan documents. A mix of high-value oversight and repetitive administrative work.

                           * Administrative support: spread across acquisition and servicing; handles document prep, filing, signature packets, and escrow paperwork. This creates meaningful load today and is a target for automation.

These operational realities underscore where Connect 2.0 needs to go beyond tech: reducing administrative burden while amplifying expert judgment.
________________


External Partners & Ecosystem
Blueprint depends on an extended network:
                              * Consultants (surveyors, arborists, civil engineers, entitlement specialists) for entitlement cycles.

                              * Attorneys, with notable differences by market (Arizona requires far more attorney involvement than Seattle).

                              * Banks, which receive structured quarterly reporting but are not directly involved in underwriting.

The platform must reflect these ecosystem dynamics: who touches what, and how to make it smoother without over-centralizing.
________________


Workflow & Tool Friction
Current state is fragmented across tools:
                                 * Blueprint Online and Power Apps manage intake and tracking.

                                 * Connect generates documents, which are then managed outside of the system for signature (Authentisign/DocuSign) and re-uploaded.

                                 * Lots of manual filing and email handling in between.

This layering creates inefficiency and risk. The target vision is one unified flow, with automation compressing paths and data captured once, not rekeyed repeatedly.

Connect 2.0 — Platform (separate from Blueprint)
                                    * Ownership & model. Connect is owned by Datapage (Darin is a partner) and licensed to Blueprint — Connect 2.0 continues that model. Connect already serves external users (e.g., Send Capital, Create) — unmarketed but validated.

                                    * Product thesis. A multi-tenant, modular, AI-native platform with a common data model + semantic layer, offering configurable modules for entitlements, feasibility, builder management, design, lending/servicing, along with future expansion. Blueprint is Client Zero for proving modules, economics, and operations.

                                    * Why the separation matters. It lets Blueprint optimize for operating outcomes while Connect optimizes for monetizable product. Each improvement for Blueprint becomes a platform module without conflating P&Ls or narratives.

Candidate Use Cases (no sequencing implied)
Lead & Feasibility
                                       * Auto-vet MLS/agent submissions; predict fit vs. criteria; highlight zoning/parcel constraints.

                                       * Natural-language queries for agents (“What can I build on 123 Main?”) with instant feasibility summaries.

Entitlement & Design
                                          * AI-assisted entitlement checks; correction-cycle prediction; permit packet generation; single status thread for builders/agents.

                                          * Consultant orchestration: auto-dispatch, SLAs, handoffs, and milestones.

                                          * Design accelerators using the library of 1,500+ plan sets to produce rapid concepts that respect site constraints.

Builder Assignment & Development
                                             * Recommendation engine for builder matching (geo, history, quality, cost/variance, capacity).

                                             * Builder performance dashboards; pipeline balance and “time-to-start” indicators.

Lending & Servicing
                                                * Draws and progress tracking; early-risk signals (inspection slippage, entitlement stalls); investor yield forecasting.

Data & Insights
                                                   * A structured digital thread from intake through servicing.

                                                   * Market trend lenses (entitlement cycle times by jurisdiction; plan types that clear fastest).

                                                   * Explore insight/API products (post-Blueprint proof, with rights/controls).

Client Experience
                                                      * Conversational/voice agents answering “Where is my permit/draw right now?” and surfacing blockers.

                                                      * Move from static PDFs to interactive data exploration: queryable maps, entitlement/utility overlays, live dashboards.

Technology POV (Principles We Agreed On)
                                                         * Foundation first: establish the common data model, multi-tenant architecture, identity/RBAC, and telemetry before layering on use cases.

                                                         * Vertical slices, not monoliths: deliver end-to-end functionality in thin slices that prove value and surface issues early.

                                                         * Composable design: build modules that can be swapped, extended, or replaced as needs evolve, recognizing that some components may have shorter lifespans.

                                                         * Pragmatic AI: apply models where Blueprint’s historical data and repeatable patterns exist, and embed those models into guided workflows so users experience clear recommendations and structured outputs rather than raw AI tools.

                                                         * Agile rhythm: quarterly planning, two-week sprints, frequent demos — keeping priorities flexible and aligned to business needs.

Agreed Actions on Vendors
                                                            * The team is aligned that existing development vendors will be fully supplanted as Connect 2.0 comes online.

                                                            * SeedCode (the primary current vendor) will be transitioned away from active development and retained only under an SLA-based support model for the remaining lifecycle of current platforms.

                                                            * Redcloud has provided some point solutions in the past but is not actively engaged today.

                                                            * Going forward, all new development and enhancements will be delivered through the Connect 2.0 architecture, under IA leadership.

Business Case Discussions
We agreed both programs require clear business cases — but for different purposes and audiences.
Blueprint (Frontier Firm Transformation)
                                                               * Business case should clarify the internal ROI: why now, and how organizational and operating model changes drive market share growth, builder loyalty, and sustained investor yield.

                                                               * It must connect transformation directly back to the candidate goals: market share, revenue, yield, employee satisfaction, client satisfaction.

                                                               * Audience: Blueprint leadership, employees, and investors — demonstrating that transformation strengthens the operator.

Connect 2.0[c] (Datapage Platform)
                                                                  * Business case must capture the external opportunity: Connect 2.0 as a multi-tenant platform that can scale nationally.

                                                                  * It should emphasize Blueprint as Client Zero, and the modular design (entitlements, design, feasibility, builder matching, servicing) as reusable components.

                                                                  * Audience: Datapage stakeholders, potential partners, investors — focusing on product/market opportunity and platform commercialization.

Approach
                                                                     * Both cases should be evidence-driven, anchored in Blueprint’s data (3,000+ leads/year, $3B in zero-default loans, entitlement timelines, builder participation rates).

                                                                     * They should be developed as separate but aligned artifacts — Blueprint’s case for internal transformation, Connect’s case for external scale.

                                                                     * Timing wasn’t finalized, but consensus was that business cases need to be built early enough to anchor prioritization and sequencing decisions.

Near-Term Focus Areas
                                                                        * Decide where to start: Entitlement/Design, Feasibility, or Servicing, based on value, feasibility, and dependencies.

                                                                        * Finalize OGSM: refine the draft objective, validate candidate goals, confirm strategies, and select measures with Darin’s input.

                                                                        * Build business cases: create aligned but separate cases — one for Blueprint’s transformation, one for Connect 2.0’s platform opportunity.

                                                                        * Translate into backlog & cost model: structure the work and candidate use cases into an actionable backlog that can be costed.

                                                                        * Reconvene in ~2 weeks: review with Darin when he returns, to align on MVP scope, backlog, and investment model.

Why this plan fits Blueprint (grounded, not generic)
                                                                           * Operating proof: 3k+ leads in the first half of last year alone; a reputation for minute-level responses that win deals. The operating engine is real; we’re systematizing it.

                                                                           * Risk discipline: Zero defaults and local expertise — much of which can be encoded as checks, rules, and heuristics in Connect modules without losing the human loop.

                                                                           * Platform signal: Connect is already in use outside Blueprint (Send Capital, Create) — proving product viability beyond a single tenant.

“How We Got Here” — Select Moments (for context)
                                                                              * On national scale vs. local expertise: “You can’t go into any market and be an expert on codes; you need local expertise.”

                                                                              * On stability for small builders: “A platform enables 60 small builders to thrive — not get whipsawed by cycles.”

                                                                              * On speed as identity: Agents don’t want to wait a day for answers — minutes matter; Blueprint built systems to deliver that.

                                                                              * On Connect’s broader role: Connect already runs beyond Blueprint (“Send Capital”, “Create”); no marketing yet — organic validation.

                                                                              * On build philosophy: Don’t replicate old human steps with robots; compress paths, deliver outcomes, build replaceable parts, and ship early/evolve.

Closing
We left this workshop with a shared lens, a validated separation of operator vs. platform, and a path to MVP decisions. The next decision is which slice to lead with. We will reconvene in ~2 weeks, when Darin is back in town, to align on MVP scope, review the initial backlog and cost models, and make the decisions needed to move forward into delivery.

                                                                                 * Blueprint: The operating company focused on infill land development and lending, currently active in Seattle and Phoenix.

                                                                                 * Connect / Connect 2.0: The technology platform owned by Datapage (in which Darin is a partner) and licensed to Blueprint. Connect 2.0 is the rebuilt, multi-tenant, AI-native version intended to serve both Blueprint and external clients.

                                                                                 * Client Zero: The first client and proving ground for a platform. In this context, Blueprint serves as Client Zero for Connect 2.0.

                                                                                 * Entitlement: The process of securing municipal approvals to develop land (permits, zoning clearances, and corrections). Requires coordination across consultants (surveyors, arborists, civil/structural engineers, etc.) and city agencies.

                                                                                 * Design team: Internal team that manages Blueprint’s ~1,500 plan sets and produces plan packages that flow into feasibility and entitlement processes.

                                                                                 * Builder/Owner: The property developer (often a small to mid-sized builder) seeking financing and approvals through Blueprint.

                                                                                 * Acquisition team: Handles lead intake, acquisition decisions, and feasibility assessments (supported by feasibility associates).

                                                                                 * Servicing team: Six-person team managing escrow, loan documents, draws, and ongoing builder interactions post-close.

                                                                                 * Administrative support: Roles spread across acquisition and servicing that handle document prep, filing, signature packets, and escrow paperwork.

                                                                                 * OGSM: A strategy tool that frames Objectives, Goals, Strategies, and Measures. Used here to draft candidate elements of Blueprint’s strategic lens.

                                                                                 * Frontier firm: A firm that doesn’t just modernize existing processes but pioneers new operating models by embedding data, AI, and structured decision-making into its fabric from day one.

                                                                                 * Progressive profiling: A method where information accumulates progressively across a deal’s lifecycle, enabling viability scores and dashboards that update continuously instead of relying on static packets.

                                                                                 * Agile rhythm: Operating cadence using quarterly program increments for planning and two-week sprints with demos for delivery.

AI & Technology Terms
                                                                                    * Digital thread: A connected data fabric linking all steps in the lifecycle (intake → entitlement → lending → servicing), allowing each action to update the system of record and feed downstream decisions.

                                                                                    * Pragmatic AI: Applying machine learning only where Blueprint has the repeatable data to support it, embedding outputs into workflows so users get clear recommendations or structured outputs — not raw AI tools.

                                                                                    * Semantic layer: A standardized data model that makes information consistent and queryable across modules, so feasibility, entitlement, builder matching, and servicing all share a common language.

                                                                                    * Multi-tenant architecture: A software design where multiple clients (Blueprint, other lenders, or developers) can run on the same platform with secure separation of their data and configurations.

                                                                                    * Composable design: Building software modules in a way that allows them to be reused, replaced, or extended independently — avoiding rigid monoliths.


[a]In the OGSM framework, Measures need to be tied directly to one or more Strategy, so this section needs to be revisited. Measures are how Blueprint will tell whether its Strategies are on track.
[b]Noting this is missing the Blueprint investors and board
[c]Calling out the need to disambiguate our words here: Let's use a specific word like NewCo for the business entity, and Connect 2.0 or similar for the technology platform. They should be two separate altitudes of conversation.
